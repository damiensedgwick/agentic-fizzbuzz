# Agentic FizzBuzz

How many agents does it take to FizzBuzz?

## The Goal

In order to understand agentic systems a little better, a familiar problem is
being decomposed into multiple, independent agents that will each have a specific task.

## The Agents

[ ] - Orchastration Agent: manages the workflow between agents

[ ] - FizzBuzz Agent: determines whether to return a number, fizz, buzz or fizzbuzz

[ ] - Validator Agent: validates whether the FizzBuzz Agent is correct or not

[ ] - Result Agent: tells the user the result of the FizzBuzz Agent (success|error)
